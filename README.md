### Hi there 👋

#### **My name is Miguel Rangel (also known as denyncrawford), welcome!!**. 

I'm a Full-Stack JS programer, inspired by open source, to open source. I like to learn new technologies and die trying to implement them... people say I learned JS 😝 ` const { deno , node } = 🖤;`.

- 🔭 **I’m currently working on**:

  ```javascript
  import Mantra from 'https://github.com/mantra-cms/' 
  // A cms built on Deno (TOP SECRET). 
  ```
  ```javascript
  import VueFlyRoutes from 'https://github.com/denyncrawford/vue-flyroutes' 
  // Advanced transitions handler for the Vue Router.
  ```
  ```javascript
  import DenoFiglet from 'https://github.com/denyncrawford/deno-figlet' 
  // FIGlet font generator built on Deno (for Deno and Browser).
  ```
  ```javascript
  import Dropper from 'https://github.com/denyncrawford/dropper' 
  // Event-based WebSocket module for express. (REALTIME DATA, OH YEAHHH!!!) 
  ```
  
  > Check out my repos to see all my projects 👀.
  
  I am in love with Deno 🦕 and I'm looking for friends to talk about pterodaptiles!!!
